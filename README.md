#Facebook Element for the Fusion Page Builder

This plugin will add a Facebook page element to the Avada Fusion Builder. It essentially works in the same way the Avada Facebook widget works, but available in the Fusion Builder interface.

To use, simply upload these files into your /wp-content/plugins/ folder so that your directory looks like so:

/wp-content/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/plugins/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/fb-facebook/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/preview/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fb-facebook.php

The code is quite straight forward, so feel free to browser around if you're interested in building some extensions for the Fusion Builder. I wrote this extension because I needed it for a website I was putting together, I'll try and remember to update this repository if I make any changes to the extension.

Enjoy!
